# Astro with Preact app using Pokemon API

Pokemon API is taken from personal github gist (modified a bit [Pokeapi extracted data](https://gist.github.com/saninmersion/f2999d482ba4c64f97b5156cd3681e7c)). Details about pokemons are used from [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/).

Astro website builder with Preact is used to build an application for SSR where 100 Pokemons (in those 100 their transformations are included) are presented on the homepage. Each pokemon can be clicked on and details about each can be seen.

Global styles, as well as module.css styles are used for components. Components are in the Components folder. Also, layout is created to show header and footer on each page. For some components astro is used. Mix of Preact and Astro components is used for some web pages (which is really cool and convenient).
